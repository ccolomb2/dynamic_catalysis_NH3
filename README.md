This repository contains three Jupyter Notebooks with code to generate the results for the paper "Dynamic Catalysis for Ammonia Synthesis: Cyclic Steady-State Simulation and Insights into Forcing Signal Parameters" by Carolina Colombo Tedesco, John R. Kitchin, and Carl Laird. The paper was submitted to the ESCAPE 35 Conference.


The .csv files are necessary to run the notebooks, as they have data used in the simulations.
